# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
*A playwrite, Louise, made a Kickstarter campaign for her play "Fever." She now wants a deeper analysis about what makes a Kickstarter more likely to be successful.
 
### Purpose
*The purpose of this project was to analyze Kickstarter success by factoring in their Kickstarter financial goals and launch dates. 

## Analysis and Challenges
*This project analyzed outcomes of a kickstarter based on two main factors:\
	1. Launch Date of the kickstarter\

	2. Financial goals of the kickstarter\
 ![Outcomes_Based_On_Goals](https://github.com/Paul-Lecander/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

*Launch date is the date at which the Kickstarter campaign started, and the financial goals was the amount of money the Kickstarter hoped to raise by the end of the campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
*The most successful month to launch a kickstarter is in May which had a success rate of 67%.\
*Kickstarters that were launched in the month of December saw the lowest rate of success with only 49% of campaigns coming to fruition.\
*Kickstarters launched between February and July had Kickstarters launched in December had the least success.\  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
*More likely to be successful if the goal is less than $15000. Only a total of nine campaigns had a goal between $35000 and $44999, but the ones that did were 67% successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*There weren't many challenges to this dataset; however, some difficulties that could be encountered would be gathering the data or finding where the data has been aggregated. 


## Results

*The most successful month to launch a kickstarter is in May which had a success rate of 67%.\
*Kickstarters that were launched in the month of December saw the lowest rate of success with only 49% of campaigns coming to fruition.\ 
*Kickstarters launched between February and July had Kickstarters launched in December had the least success.\  

*A Kickstarter campaign is more likely to succeed as long as the goal of the campaign is less than $15,000.

*Some limitations to this dataset include the size of the dataset, there could also be errors in the dataset such as miscategorized categories by whoever created the dataset.

*Some other tables that could be created to help analyze success on date launched and goal would be something to merge the two factors together.  It would be interesting to see if the goals set by campaigns in December were higher than average, that could be a cause of why so many campaigns are failing in December.
